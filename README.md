# Recipe Buddy
A user-friendly, simple application for storing, managing, and using all your favorite recipes!
Our front-end runs off of simple HTML and CSS, as well as utilizing Node.js to connect to our backend services, a firestore database running off of a Firebase server. We are hoping to be able to host our website off this same Firebase server as well.
